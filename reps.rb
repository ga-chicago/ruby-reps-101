# ROUND 1
# Write a function lengths that accepts a single parameter as 
# an argument, namely an array of strings. The function should 
# return an array of numbers. Each number in the array should be 
# the length of the corresponding string.

# words = ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"]

# ROUND 2
# Write a Ruby function called transmogrifier This function should 
# accept three arguments, which you can assume will be numbers. 
# Your function should return the "transmogrified" result

# The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product 
# (numbers multiplied together) of the first two numbers, 
# raised to the power (exponentially) of the third number.

# For example, the transmogrified result of 5, 3, and 2 is 
# (5 times 3) to the power of 2 is 225.

# Use your function to find the following answers.

# transmogrifier(5, 4, 3)
# transmogrifier(13, 12, 5)
# transmogrifier(42, 13, 7)

def transmogrifier(num1, num2, num3)

p transmogrifier(42, 13, 7) #=>14466001271480793216

#ROUND 3
#Write a function called toonify that takes two parameters, 
# accent and sentence.

# If accent is the string "daffy", return a modified version 
# of sentence with all "s" replaced with "th".

# If the accent is "elmer", replace all "r" with "w".
# Feel free to add your own accents as well!

# If the accent is not recognized, just return the sentence as-is.
# toonify("daffy", "so you smell like sausage")
#=> "tho you thmell like thauthage"

#ROUND 4
# Write a function wordReverse that accepts a single argument, 
# a string. The method should return a string with the order 
# of the words reversed. Don't worry about punctuation.

# wordReverse("Now I know what a TV dinner feels like")
# # => "like feels dinner TV a what know I Now"

def word_reverse(num)
	p num.split.reverse.join(" ")
end

word_reverse('I am having a great time')

#ROUND 5***
# Write a function letterReverse that accepts a single argument, 
# a string. The function should maintain the order of words in 
# the string but reverse the letters in each word. 
# Don't worry about punctuation. This will be very similar to 
# round 4 except you won't need to split them with a space.

# letterReverse("Now I know what a TV dinner feels like")
# # => "woN I wonk tahw a VT rennid sleef ekil"
# letterReverse("Put Hans back on the line")
