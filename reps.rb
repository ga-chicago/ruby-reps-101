# ROUND 1
# Write a function lengths that accepts a single parameter as 
# an argument, namely an array of strings. The function should 
# return an array of numbers. Each number in the array should be 
# the length of the corresponding string.

# words = ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"]
# lengths(words)  # => [5, 4, 2, 2, 4]

def leng_of_word(arr)

	p arr.map{|word| word.length}
end

leng_of_word(["the", "class", "was", "awesome"])

# ROUND 2
# Write a Ruby function called transmogrifier This function should 
# accept three arguments, which you can assume will be numbers. 
# Your function should return the "transmogrified" result

# The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product 
# (numbers multiplied together) of the first two numbers, 
# raised to the power (exponentially) of the third number.

# For example, the transmogrified result of 5, 3, and 2 is 
# (5 times 3) to the power of 2 is 225.

# Use your function to find the following answers.

# transmogrifier(5, 4, 3)
# transmogrifier(13, 12, 5)
# transmogrifier(42, 13, 7)

def transmogrifier(num1, num2, num3)
	(num1 * num2) ** num3
end

p transmogrifier(5, 3, 2) #=>225
p transmogrifier(5, 4, 3) #=>8000
p transmogrifier(13, 12, 5) #=>92389579776
p transmogrifier(42, 13, 7) #=>14466001271480793216

#ROUND 3
#Write a function called toonify that takes two parameters, 
# accent and sentence.

# If accent is the string "daffy", return a modified version 
# of sentence with all "s" replaced with "th".

# If the accent is "elmer", replace all "r" with "w".
# Feel free to add your own accents as well!

# If the accent is not recognized, just return the sentence as-is.
# toonify("daffy", "so you smell like sausage")
#=> "tho you thmell like thauthage"
